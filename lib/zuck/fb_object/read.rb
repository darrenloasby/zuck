      # Let's say you want to fetch all campaigns
      # from facebook. This can happen in the context of an ad
      # account. In this gem, that context is called a parent. This method
      # would only be called on objects that inherit from {FbObject}.
      # It asks the `parent` for it's path (if it is given), and appends
      # it's own `list_path` property that you have defined (see
      # list_path)
      #
      # If, however, you want to fetch all ad creatives, regardless of
      # which ad group is their parent, you can omit the `parent`
      # parameter. The creatives returned by `Zuck::AdCreative.all` will
      # return `nil` when you call `#ad_group` on them, though, because facebook
      # will not return this information. So if you can, try to fetch 
      # objects through their direct parent, e.g.
      # `my_ad_group.ad_creatives`.
      #
      # You can also pass a custom arg hash to be forwarded to `graph.get_object` to
      # filter the result set with additional params, e.g. to find insights for a
      # date range:
      # `campaign.insights(time_range: \{since: date1.to_s, until: date2.to_s\})
